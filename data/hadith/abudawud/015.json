He garlanded and marked the sacrificial animals, and entered the sacred state of Umrah. He then went on with the tradition. The Prophet moved on and when he came to the mountain, pass by which one descends (to Mecca) to them, his riding-beast knelt down, and the people said twice: Go on, go on, al-Qaswa has become jaded. The Prophet (May peace be upon him) said: She has not become jaded and that is not a characteristic of hers, but He Who restrained the elephant has restrained her. He then said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, they will not ask any me good thing by which they honor which God has made sacred without my giving them it. He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from them, and stopped at the farthest side of al-Hudaibiyyah at a pool with little water. Meanwhile Budail bin Warqa al-Khuza’I came, and ‘Urwah bin Mas’ud joined him. He began to speak to the Prophet (ﷺ). Whenever he spoke to the Prophet (ﷺ), he caught his beard. Al Mughriah bin Shu’bah was standing beside the Prophet (ﷺ).He had a sword with him, wearing a helmet. He (Al Mughriah) struck his (‘Urwah’s) hand with the lower end of his sheath, and said: Keep away your hand from his beard. ‘Urwah then raised his hand and asked: Who is this? They replied: Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah. He said: O treacherous one! Did I not use my offices in your treachery? In pre-Islamic days Al-Mughirah bin Shu’bah accompanied some people and murdered them, and took their property. He then came (to the Prophet) and embraced Islam. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: As for Islam we accepted it, but as to the property, as it has been taken by treachery, we have no need of it. He went on with the tradition the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Write down: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has decided. He then narrated the tradition. Suhail then said: And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without you sending him back to us. When he finished drawing up the document, the Prophet (ﷺ) said to his Companions: Get up and sacrifice and then shave. Thereafter some believing women who were immigrants came. (Allah sent down: O yea who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants). Allah most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. He then returned to Medina. Abu Basir a man from the Quraish (who was a Muslim), came to him. And they sent (two men) to look for him; so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhu Al Hulaifah and alighted to eat some dates which they had, Abu Basir said to one of the men : I swear by Allah so-and-so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; the other drew the sword and said : Yes I have tried it. Abu Basir said: Let me look at it. He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled and came to Medina, and running entered the mosque. The Prophet ( may peace be upon him) said: This man has seen something frightful. He said: I swear by Allah that my Companion has been killed, and im as good as dead. Abu Basir then arrived and said: Allah has fulfilled your covenant. You returned me to them, but Allah saved me from them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war!
