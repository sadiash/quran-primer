I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOne day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)?  \n\n\n\n\n\nI said: Yes.  He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA man said: Messenger of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful).  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word \"here\". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of Allah?  \n\n\n\n\n\nThey replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) so that he could see her and listen to her.  \n\n\n\n\n\nShe said: Messenger of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe narrator, Musa, said: Hammad narrated this tradition from al-Jarir from AbuNadrah from at-Tufawi.","grade":null,"narratedBy":"Narrated AbuHurayrah:"}]}
