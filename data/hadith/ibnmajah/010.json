When Ramadan began, I declared Zihar upon my wife (to last) until Ramadan ended. While she was talking to me one night, part of her body became uncovered. I jumped on her and had intercourse with her. The next morning I went to my people and told them, and said to them: 'Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for me.' They said: 'We will not do that, lest Allah reveal Quran concerning us or the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) says, something about us, and it will be a lasting source of disgrace for us. Rather we will leave you to deal with it yourself. Go yourself and tell the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) about your problem.' So I went out and when I came to him, I told him what happened. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Did you really do that?' I said: 'I really did that, and here I am, O Messenger of Allah. (ﷺ) I will bear Allah’s ruling on me with patience.' He said: 'Free a slave.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truth, I do not own anything but myself.' He said: 'Fast for two consecutive months.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the thing that happened to me was only because of fasting.' He said: 'Then give charity, or feed sixty poor persons.' I said: 'By the One Who sent you with the truttu we spent last night with no dinner.' He said: 'Then go to the collector of charity of Banu Zuraiq, and tell him to give you something, then feed sixty poor persons, and benefit from the rest.'\"", "grade": "Da'if (Darussalam)", "narratedBy": "It was narrated that Salamah bin Sakhr Al-Bayadi said:", "reference": "https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2062", "inBookReference": "Book 10, Hadith 47"}, {"id": 48, "hadithNumber": "2063", "text": "It was narrated from 'Urwah bin Zubair, that 'Aishah said: \"Blessed is the One Whose hearing encompasses all things.
