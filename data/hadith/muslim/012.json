To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field.

And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as deeds.

Suhail said: I do not know whether he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), what about the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As regards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden.
