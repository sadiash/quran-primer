This is the view of Malik bin Anas.\n\nAhmad said: \"Whatever is reported from the Prophet (ﷺ) about the prostrations from As-Sahw then it is acted upon in either case.\" He saw that when one stands after Rak'ah then according to the Hadith of Ibn Buhainah, he is to perform the prostrations before the Salam. When he prays five for Zuhr, then performs the prostrations after the Salam, and if he says Salam after two Rak'ahs of Zuhr or 'Asr then he performs the prostrations after the Salam. All of them are to be acted upon depending upon the case, and in the cases where nothing is reported from the Prophet (ﷺ), then two prostrations are performed for As-Sahw before the Salam.\n\nIshaq said the same as Ahmad about all of this, with the exception that he said that for every case of As-Sahw that is not mentioned from the Prophet (ﷺ), then if it is an addition to the Salat, then prostrations are performed after the Salam, and if it is something that was left out, then the prostrations are performed before the Salam.","grade":null,"narratedBy":"There is a narrated with another chain that Abu Hurairah and   As-Sa'id Al-Qari' would perform the prostrations of As-Sahw before the Taslim.\n\nAbu 'Eisa said:"},{"id":245,"hadithNumber":"245","text":"\"The Prophet (S) prayed five (Rakah) for Zuhr, so it was said to him: 'Has the prayer been added to, or have you merely forgotten?'
