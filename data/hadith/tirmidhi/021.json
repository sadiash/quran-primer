When you meet your enemy among the idolaters, then call them to one of the three options or choices, whichever of them they respond to then accept it from them, and refrain from them. Call them to Islam, and to relocate from their land to the land of Emigrants. Inform them that if they do that, then they will have similar to what those who emigrated have, and from them will be required similar to what is required from those who have emigrated. And if they refuse to relocate, then inform them that they will be like the Bedouins among the Muslim, and they will be treated the same as Bedouins are\ntreated. There is no war spoils or Fay' for them, unless they fight along with the Muslims. If they refuse then seek aid from Allah against them and fight them.
