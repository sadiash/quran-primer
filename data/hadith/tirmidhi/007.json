Isaq bin Ibrahim said: At-Tashbih is only when one says 'Hand; like a hand or similar to a hand' or 'Hearing; like hearing or similar to hearing.' So\nwhen one says 'Hearing; like hearing or similar to hearing' then this is the Tashbih. As for when one says as Allah (Most High) said, Hand, Hearing, Seeing, and he does not say 'how' nor say 'similar to hearing' nor 'like hearing' then this is not Tashbih.
