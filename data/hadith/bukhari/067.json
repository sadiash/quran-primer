One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. \"Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him.\" Her husband would then keep away from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, \"You (all) know waht you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!\" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that.

I said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear \nthat Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask \nmore from the Prophet (ﷺ) and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me \nwhatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., `Aisha) in her manners for \nshe is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet (ﷺ) .\" `Umar added,\"At that time a talk \nwas circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. \nMy Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and \nknocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He \nsaid, 'Today a great thing has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?' He \nsaid, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ); has \ndivorced his wives. `Umar added, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives and I said \"Hafsa is a \nruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. \nSo I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet (ﷺ) and then the Prophet; entered an \nupper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, 'What \nmakes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet (ﷺ) divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not \nknow. There he is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group \nof people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not \nendure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of \nhis, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet (ﷺ) ) for `Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet (ﷺ) and mentioned you but he \nkept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not \nbear the situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the permission for `Umar?'

We, the people \nof Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the \nmen (here) were overpowered by their women.' The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled and then I said to him, 'Will you \nheed what I say, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)? \nI entered upon Hafsa and said to her, \"Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (`Aisha), for she \nis more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' \" The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled for a second time. \nWhen I saw him smiling, I sat down.

These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.' I \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Ask Allah to forgive me.' Then the Prophet (ﷺ) kept away from his wives for \ntwenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to `Aisha. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) had said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because of his anger \ntowards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet (ﷺ) \nfirst entered upon `Aisha. `Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! You had sworn that you would not \nenter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting \nthem one by one.' The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' `Aisha added, 'Then \nAllah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose \nhim.' Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what `Aisha had said . \" (1) The Prophet, ' \nhad decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed \nhim for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted \nthem for one month.
