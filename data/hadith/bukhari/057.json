I don't think \nyour property will cover it.\" On that `Abdullah said to him, \"What if it is two million and two hundred \nthousand?\" \nHakim said, \"I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.\" Az- \nZubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. `Abdullah sold it for one \nmillion and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, \"Any person who has any money \nclaim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.\" There came to him `Abdullah bin Ja`far whom \nAz-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, \"If you wish I will \nforgive you the debt.\" `Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, \"No.\" Then Ibn Ja`far said, \"If you wish you \ncan defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.\" Ibn Az-Zubair said, \"No.\" \n`Abdullah bin Ja`far said, \"Give me a piece of the land.\" `Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), \n\"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of \nthe property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from \nthe land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while `Amr bin `Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az- \nZubair and Ibn Zam`a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, \"At what price have you appraised Al- \nGhaba?\" He said, \"One hundred thousand for each share,\" Muawiya asked, \"How many shares have \nbeen left?\" `Abdullah replied, \"Four and a half shares.\" \nAl-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" `Amr bin \n`Uthman said, \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam`a said, \"I would \nlike to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Muawiya said, \"How much is left now?\" `Abdullah \nreplied, \"One share and a half.\" Muawiya said, \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty \nthousand.\" `Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had \npaid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said, \"No, \nby Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would \nthose who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.\" So, he started \nto announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the \ninheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property \nwas excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred \nthousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.","grade":null,"narratedBy":"Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:"},{"id":39,"hadithNumber":"39","text":"`Uthman did not join the Badr battle because he was married to one of the daughters of Allah's \nApostle and she was ill.
