Then `Abbas said, \"O chief of the \nbelievers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali).\" They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani \nAn-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai.

Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by \nAllah do you know this?\" They replies in the affirmative. `Umar then said to `Ali and `Abbas. \"I ask \nyou by Allah, do you know this?\" `Umar added, \"When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu \nBakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it \nin the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightlyguided, \nand he was a follower of what was right. \nThen Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in \nmy possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nused to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, \nand a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the \nsame claim and presenting the same case; you, `Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your \nnephew's property, and this man, i.e. `Ali, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's \nproperty.

So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over \nto us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you.

Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no \nDinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in \nMedina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed \nwas, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az-Zubair would say, \"No, (i won't \nkeep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.\" Az-Zubair was never \nappointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his \nwealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the \nProphet, Abu Bakr, `Umar, and `Uthman.
