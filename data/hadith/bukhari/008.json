Then he took my hand and \nascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the \ngatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: \n'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He \nasked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest \nheaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he \nlooked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, \n'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and \nthe people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of \nParadise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and \nwhen he looks towards his left he weeps.' \nThen he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, \n'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said \nand he opened the gate. Anas said: \"Abu Dhar added that the Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus \nand Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he \n(the Prophet (ﷺ) ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven.

Gabriel replied, 'He is Jesus. \nThen I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, \n'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham.

I replied, 'He has enjoined \nfifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers \nwill not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to \nhalf. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your \nfollowers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and \nhalf of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your \nfollowers will not be able to bear it.
