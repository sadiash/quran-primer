Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your \nfather; pay your greetings to him.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You \nare welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. \nthe Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near \nMedina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This is the Lote Tree of the \nutmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, \n'What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?' He replied,' As for the hidden rivers, they are two \nrivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' \nThen Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and \nanother full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, \n'This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.' Then the prayers were \nenjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), \n'What have you been ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.' Moses \nsaid, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, \nand I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to \nlessen your followers' burden.' So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I \ncame to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and \nHe reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and \nHe ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same \nadvice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day. \nWhen I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to \nobserve five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I \nhave got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go \nback to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower's burden.'

When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, \"O Abu Bakr!

Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house. Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\" At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.", "grade": "Sahih", "narratedBy": "Narrated 'Aisha:", "reference": "https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3905", "inBookReference": "Book 63, Hadith 130"}, {"id": 131, "hadithNumber": "3906", "text": "The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, \"The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and said, \"O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.\" Suraqa added, \"I too realized that it must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, \"Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head.\" Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Do not tell others about us.\" Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) proceeded on his way. Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage. The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the summit of Harra. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, \"No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then built a mosque there. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.\" Thus the Prophet (ﷺ) recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me.

Who is this man in front of you?\" Abu Bakr \nwould say, \"This man shows me the Way,\" One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in \nfact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider \npursuing them. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! This is a horse-rider pursuing us.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) looked \nbehind and said, \"O Allah! Cause him to fall down.\" So the horse threw him down and got up \nneighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, \"O Allah's Prophet! Order me whatever you want.\" The \nProphet said, \"Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.\" So, in the first part of the \nday Suraqa was an enemy of Allah's Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah's \nApostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Allah's \nProphet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they said, \"Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.\" \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news \nthat Allah's Prophet had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking \nand saying \"Allah's Prophet has come! Allah's Prophet has come!
