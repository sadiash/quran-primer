I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows \nbehind him; and he offered two rak`at, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim \nwith him. I detained him for a meal called \"Khazir\" which I had prepared for him.--(\"Khazir\" is a \nspecial type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)-- \nWhen the neighbors got the news that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in my house, they poured it till there were a \ngreat number of men in the house.
