While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet (ﷺ) was brought to \nHeraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded \nit to Heraclius. Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a \nprophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered \nupon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest \nrelative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my \ncompanions sit behind me. \nThen he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I \nam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me \na lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions \nwould consider me a liar, I would have told lies. \nHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst \nyou? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.\" \nHeraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' \nHe said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' \nHe said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I \nsaid, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' \nHe said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and \nvictory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties \nupon him.' \nHe said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not \nknow what he will do in it\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a \nword (against him) except that. \nHeraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, \n'No.' \nThen Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), \n'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family \namongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. \nThen I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought \nthat had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to \nrule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. \nThen I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, \nand you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about \nothers, could ever tell a lie about Allah. \nThen I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after \nembracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon \nI thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a \nman copying some sayings said before him.\" \nAbu Safyan said, \"Heraclius then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He orders us (to \noffer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.' \nThen Heraclius said, 'If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and read it wherein was written: \n\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, \nApostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine........ Peace be upon him who follows the \nRight Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from \nAllah's Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, \nyou will be responsible for the sins of the tillers (i.e. the people of your kingdom) and (Allah's Statement):--\"O the \npeople of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship \nNone but Allah....bear witness that we are Muslims.' (3.64) \nWhen he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, \nand we were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"While coming out, I said to my companions, \n'The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al14 \nAsfar is afraid of him.' So I continued to believe that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would be victorious, till Allah \nmade me embrace Islam.\" Az-Zuhri said, \"Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and \nhad them assembled in his house and said, 'O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent \nsuccess and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?' (Immediately after hearing \nthat), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, \n'Bring them back to me.' So he called them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your \nadherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.'

He said, 'Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?' Moses said, 'I \nhave come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught. \nAl-Khadir said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of \nAllah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some \nof Allah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.\" Moses said, \"Allah \nwilling, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.' (18.6) Al-Khadir said to \nhim. 'If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' \n(18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested \nthe crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board \nfree of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the \nplanks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.' These people gave us a free lift, yet you have \nscuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.' (18.71) \nAl-Khadir said, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me ?' (18.72) Moses said, 'Call me not \nto account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)\" (18.73) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow \ncame and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, \n'My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah's knowledge is like what this sparrow has \ntaken out of the sea.' Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, \nAl-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it \nout with his hands and killed him. Moses said, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed \nnobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.' (18.74) He said, \"Didn't I tell you that you can have no \npatience with me?' (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) \nMoses said, 'If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received \nan excuse from me.' (18.76) \nThen they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they \nrefused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) \nAl-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, 'These are people to whom we came, but \nthey neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some \nrecompense for it. Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation \nof (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.'

Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end \r\nunder his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said \r\nastonishingly, 'Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes.' Al-Khadir said, \"What do you \r\nwant?' Moses said, ' I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.' Al- \r\nKhadir said, 'Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration \r\ncomes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a \r\nknowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: \r\nAl-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like \r\nwhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). \r\nThey found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The \r\ncrew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Allah.' (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" \r\nHe said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, 'We will not get him on board with fare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the \r\nboat and then plugged the hole with a piece of wood. \r\nMoses said, 'Have you scuttled it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. \r\n(18.71) (Mujahid said. \"Moses said so protestingly.\") Al-Khadir said, didn't I say that you can have no \r\npatience with me?' (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forgetfulness, the second \r\ncaused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done intentionally. Moses said, 'Call \r\nme not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).' (18.73) \r\n(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him.

Moses \r\nsaid, 'Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody' (18.74) Then they proceeded and found \r\na wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight. Sa`id moved his hand \r\nthus and said 'Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya`la said, 'I think Sa`id said, \r\n'Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you \r\nhad wished, you could have taken wages for it.' Sa`id said, 'Wages that we might had eaten.' And there \r\nwas a king in furor (ahead) of them\" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn `Abbas recited: 'In \r\nfront of them (was) a king.' \r\nIt is said on the authority of somebody other than Sa`id that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say \r\nthat the boy was called Haisur. 'A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that \r\nboat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would \r\nrepair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some \r\nsaid with tar. 'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we (Khadir) feared \r\nlest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.'

So Moses set out along with his attendant \nYusha` bin Noon, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses \nput his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than `Amr said) 'At the \nrock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became \nalive.

Once he drew lots \nwhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah's \nApostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my \nhowdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah's \nApostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered to \nproceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked \non till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my \nhowdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I \nlooked for it and my search for it detained me. \nThe group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel \non which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and \nwere not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the \nhowdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. \nThen I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I \nwent to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. \nWhile I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh- \nDhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing \nplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on \nseeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna \nilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, \nhe did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel \nkneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading \nthe she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot \nmidday. \nThen whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged \nstatement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety.

I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord!
