In other words, one who seeks to discover the Truth through it will find it very simple to follow. But for one who is not serious or sincere in his search for Truth, the Quran can be impenetrable. In the present world one of the conditions for a man’s being serious is that he should not keep putting off his acceptance of the Truth. In other words, the appearance of Truth at the level of reasoning and arguments should be enough to make him accept it. One who does not accept the Truth on its being established at this level, is in effect waiting for the Truth to be laid bare before him. But when the Truth so appears, it does not do so in order to claim acceptance, but to have the accepters appreciate it and the rejecters pushed into the pit of blindness forever."},{"verseKey":"44:59","text":"The Quran is undoubtedly a great book.

While accepting the existence of God in a traditional manner, they continued to practise the religion of their forefathers and their leaders. The Quran proved the beliefs of their forefathers to be baseless, but they were not ready to accept this position. On the one hand, they found themselves without supporting arguments while, on the other, they found it impossible to banish from their minds the image of the greatness of their forefathers and leaders. This dual dilemma had pushed them into the realm of doubt. The preacher of God appeared to them too small a person for them to accept, or to act on his advice to abandon their so-called great men. Those who do not accept the Truth through persuasion expose themselves to the danger of having to accept it under threat of punishment. They may accept it in the latter instance, but at that time their acceptance will be of no avail."}]}
