# Competitive Landscape — The Primer

*Comprehensive survey of every Quran study application, knowledge tool, and AI-powered Islamic app. Evaluated against The Primer's vision: immersive reading + deep layered study + personal knowledge building + AI intelligence + beautiful design.*

---

## The Bottom Line

**No single product combines even three of The Primer's core pillars.** The Quran app ecosystem is roughly 15 years behind Bible study software (Logos, Accordance) in depth, and 5 years behind modern knowledge tools (Obsidian, Notion) in personal knowledge building. The gap is not incremental — it is generational.

---

## 2. Study-Focused Apps

- **Features:** Quran with tafsir from multiple scholars, Arabic root word search, 9+ hadith collections (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmazi, etc.), prayer times, bookmarks, notes per ayah, voice search
- **What it does well:** Includes both Quran AND hadith in one app. Arabic root word search is a genuine study feature.
- **What it lacks:** Quran and hadith are parallel databases, not cross-referenced. You cannot tap an ayah and see related hadith. No AI, no knowledge building. Ad-supported.

### Tasleem AI

- **URL:** https://tasleem.ai
- **Platform:** iOS, Android
- **Business model:** Freemium (Tasleem Pro for advanced AI)
- **Features:** Authentic Mushaf, word-by-word with audio, Khatmah tracking, AI-powered search/summaries from 100K+ authentic sources, hadith collections, fatwa databases, prayer times, spiritual tracking
- **What it does well:** Combines AI search with authentic sourcing. Privacy-first (data stays on device).
- **What it lacks:** Still a mobile-first lifestyle app, not a deep study workspace. No panel system, no note-taking depth.

### Quranic Arabic Corpus

- **URL:** https://corpus.quran.com
- **Platform:** Web
- **Business model:** Free (University of Leeds academic project)
- **Features:** Word-by-word grammar annotation for all 77,430 words, morphological analysis (POS, root, lemma, stem pattern, case, gender, number), syntactic treebank (sentence diagrams), semantic ontology of Quranic concepts with predicate logic relationships
- **What it does well:** THE deepest linguistic tool for the Quran in existence. Unmatched for morphology, syntax, and ontology. Nothing else comes close.
- **What it lacks:** Everything except linguistic analysis. 2008-era web design. No reading experience, no audio, no notes, no bookmarks. A research database, not a user-facing product.

### StudyQuran.org

- **URL:** https://studyquran.org
- **Platform:** Web
- **Business model:** Free (volunteer project)
- **Features:** Root list (Arabic roots with all derivatives, occurrences, grammatical info), Lane's Lexicon integration (all 8 volumes linked)
- **What it does well:** Root-based lexicographic study. Free Lane's Lexicon online.
- **What it lacks:** Bare HTML from the 2000s. Not a product, a passion project.

---

## 3. Knowledge Graph / Mind Map Approaches

### QuranDIY

- **URL:** https://quran.diy
- **Platform:** Web
- **Business model:** Free (solo developer covering API costs personally)
- **Features:** AI-powered chat searching Quranic text, hierarchical topic system (2,200+ topics, 390+ subthemes), **beta knowledge graph** connecting people/places/concepts from all verses using AI analysis, multiple translations, bookmarks
- **What it does well:** THE only consumer-facing product attempting a knowledge graph of the Quran. The topic system (2,200+ topics) is impressive. AI chat is grounded in Quranic text.
- **What it lacks:** Beta quality. One person, paying costs out of pocket. Basic design. Not a complete study tool — no audio, no tafsir panels, no rich notes.

### Quranic Ontology (corpus.quran.com/ontology.jsp)

- **Platform:** Web
- **Features:** Formal knowledge representation of Quranic concepts using predicate logic. Shows relationships between concepts. Navigable concept hierarchy. 300 linked concepts with 350 relations.
- **Assessment:** The most rigorous conceptual mapping of the Quran. Academic only — not user-facing.

### Academic Projects (not products)

- Multiple papers on automatic mind map generation for the Quran
- ITQAN mobile app — academic prototype for topical interpretation with mind maps
- SemanticHadith — RDF knowledge graph for hadith corpus (SPARQL queries, not consumer-facing)
- SemanticTafsir — knowledge graph for tafsir (academic)
- Various D3.js treemap visualizations of Quranic structure on GitHub

**Assessment:** Knowledge graph approaches for the Quran exist almost entirely in academia. QuranDIY is the sole consumer attempt, and it is a one-person beta. No one has built a polished, production-grade Quran knowledge graph product.

---

## 4. AI-Powered Quran Tools

### AI Quran Chat (aiquranchat.com)

- **Features:** AI answers grounded in classical tafseer (Ibn Kathir, Al-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi, As-Saadi, Al-Jalalayn)
- **Assessment:** Basic chatbot interface. Not integrated into a study experience.

### ChatILM (IslamiCity)

- **URL:** https://chatilm.islamicity.org
- **Features:** AI-powered Islamic Q&A, semantic Quran search
- **Assessment:** Backed by IslamiCity's decade of search development. Standalone chatbot.

### Deen Buddy

- **URL:** https://deenbuddyapp.com
- **Platform:** iOS, Android
- **Features:** AI Quran chat, prayer times, daily quizzes, search by verse or topic
- **Assessment:** Lightweight mobile-first. Not a deep study tool.

### WisQu

- **URL:** https://wisqu.ai
- **Features:** Islamic AI chatbot (96% claimed accuracy), multi-language including Persian, grounded in scholarly sources. Notable: explicit Shia scholarly grounding (most others default Sunni).
- **Assessment:** Standalone chatbot. Not a study platform.

**Assessment of AI Quran tools overall:** Every existing AI Quran tool is a standalone chatbot or bolt-on feature. None integrate AI into a study workflow. None offer AI-assisted note-taking, AI-powered cross-referencing, or AI that understands your personal study context. They are all "ask a question, get an answer" — the most basic AI pattern.

---

## 5. Cross-Scripture / Comparative Tools

### Scripturas

- **URL:** https://scripturas.info
- **Platform:** Web
- **Features:** AI-powered verse clustering across Hebrew Bible, Christian Bible, and Quran. Semantic similarity search. Word analysis visualization. Original language texts.
- **Assessment:** Most sophisticated cross-scripture analysis tool. Academic, not a study companion.

### Faith Explorer

- **URL:** https://faithexplorer.app
- **Platform:** iOS, Android
- **Features:** 144,000+ verses from 9 religions (17 sacred texts), AI semantic search, side-by-side comparison, 9 AI dialogue partners representing each faith, personal library with notes/folders/tags
- **Assessment:** Broadest multi-faith coverage. Jack of all trades, master of none. Not deep for any single scripture.

### Bible Quran Link

- **Platform:** iOS
- **Features:** Maps 4,100+ Bible verses to 3,300+ Quran verses. 27 Quran translations, 25 Bible translations.
- **Assessment:** Most comprehensive verse-to-verse Bible↔Quran mapping. One-dimensional — mapping only, no deeper analysis.

### Logos Bible Software (Quran content)

- **URL:** https://logos.com
- Logos sells the Quran (Arabic + English) as purchasable resources within its ecosystem. You can use Logos' powerful tools on the Quran text. But it is explicitly a Bible tool with Quran as supplementary content for comparative study — not designed for Muslim scholars.

---

## 6. The Gold Standard: Logos & Accordance

These are what The Primer should aspire to match (and exceed) for the Quran.

### Logos Bible Software

- **URL:** https://logos.com
- **Platform:** Web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
- **Pricing:** Subscription from ~$10/month. Library packages $100–$5,000+

**Features that have NO Quran equivalent:**

1. **Linked Panel System** — Bible + commentary + lexicon + cross-references open simultaneously. Scroll one, all scroll together. Click a word in the Bible, the lexicon jumps to it.
2. **Passage Guide** — Type a reference → instantly get top commentaries, cross-references, parallel passages, sermon outlines, and media, all aggregated automatically.
3. **Exegetical Guide** — Deep original-language analysis: morphology, syntax, word frequency, semantic domains.
4. **Factbook** — Wiki-like summaries of every person, place, event, concept in scripture with links to all resources.
5. **Interlinear with Morphological Tagging** — Hover over any word to see original language, morphology, definition, usage across all of scripture.
6. **Smart Search (AI)** — Natural language questions ("What does Paul say about grace?") returning relevant passages, not just keyword matches.
7. **Canvas** — Visual diagramming tool for theological concepts.
8. **Saved Layouts** — Snapshot workspace configurations and restore them.
9. **250,000+ Resources Library** — Commentaries, lexicons, dictionaries, journals — all searchable, all linked.
10. **Rich Highlighting + Notes + Visual Markups** — Annotations on any text with multiple styles.
11. **Timeline + Atlas** — Interactive maps and timelines linked to scripture.
12. **AI Summarization** — Auto-summarize articles and chapters.
13. **Cross-Device Sync** — Notes, highlights, reading plans sync everywhere.

### Accordance Bible Software

- **URL:** https://accordancebible.com
- **Platform:** macOS, Windows, iOS
- **Pricing:** Starting ~$60, research packages ~$400

**Notable features:**
1. **Single-Window Unified Workspace** — Everything in one clean interface.
2. **Drag-and-Drop Graphical Searching** — Visual search construction.
3. **Interactive 3D Maps.**
4. **Dynamic Interlinear** — Greek/Hebrew alongside English with parsing.
5. **Morphological Search** — Find every occurrence of a specific grammatical form.
6. **Speed** — Consistently praised as faster than Logos.

**The critical takeaway:** No Quran study software even attempts what Logos and Accordance do. The concept of a linked, multi-panel workspace where tafsir, morphology, hadith, cross-references, and notes all move in sync as you navigate the Quran — this does not exist anywhere.

---

## 7. DIY Knowledge Building (Obsidian / Notion)

### Obsidian Quran Ecosystem

- **Quran Obsidian Template** (github.com/omeiirr/quran-obsidian-template) — Folder structure for 114 surahs, concepts, Names of Allah. Dynamic RTL Arabic support.
- **Quran-to-Obsidian Generator** (github.com/subaanqasim/quran-to-obsidian) — Generates markdown for all surahs/ayahs with Dataview backlinking.
- **Noor Plugin** — Insert Quran verses and Hadith quotes into notes.
- **Quran Lookup Plugin** — Shorthand notation to embed Quranic verses.
- **QurStudy Vault** — In-depth study vault for 5 chapters with Arabic, translations, commentaries, thematic connections.

### Notion Quran Templates

- **The Quran Journal** — Surah tracker, Juz tracker, tafsir notes, reflection pages.
- **QuranPlus** — Memorization tracking, review scheduling, reflection journal.
- Various Islamic planners on Notion marketplace and Etsy.

**Assessment:** People ARE building Quran knowledge bases in Obsidian and Notion — demonstrating real demand. But they are fighting the tools. Obsidian has no native Arabic RTL support. Notion templates are flat trackers, not interconnected knowledge graphs. Neither tool understands Quranic structure natively — linking ayah 2:255 to its tafsir, related hadith, and thematically similar ayahs requires entirely manual labor. The demand is clearly there. The tooling is inadequate.

## 9. The Gaps That Define Our Opportunity

### 1. The linked panel workspace
Logos' killer feature. Read an ayah in one panel, see tafsir in another, morphology in a third, related hadith in a fourth — all synced. **Zero products offer this for the Quran.**

### 2. AI as a study layer, not a chatbot
AI that surfaces related ayahs as you read, generates study questions, summarizes tafsir differences, identifies thematic patterns — woven into the experience, not a separate chat window. **Nothing does this.**

### 3. Personal knowledge building
Rich notes with formatting, tagging, backlinking (like Obsidian but native to Quran). Knowledge that grows over years of study. Review what you learned about a concept across every surah you studied. **Nothing does this.**

### 4. Cross-referencing engine
Ayah-to-ayah thematic links, ayah-to-hadith links, ayah-to-historical-event links. The Quran is deeply self-referential. **No tool surfaces this programmatically.**

### 5. Beautiful + Deep
Every deep tool is ugly. Every beautiful tool is shallow. **No one has solved this.**

### 6. Desktop-class web app
The Quran market is overwhelmingly mobile-first. Serious study requires screen real estate, multiple panels, keyboard shortcuts. A web-first desktop-class experience (like Notion, Figma, or VS Code) **does not exist for Quranic study.**

### 7. Progressive knowledge graph
As a user studies, their personal knowledge graph grows — themes explored, ayahs connected, concepts mapped. **Nobody offers this.**

### 8. Root/morphology integrated into reading
The Quranic Arabic Corpus has incredible morphological data locked in a 2008-era academic website. Imagine that data powering inline tooltips in a beautiful reading experience. **Nobody has done this.**
